# Project Images

This directory contains images for the portfolio projects.

## Image Hosting

The portfolio now uses **hosted images** from external services instead of local images. This provides several benefits:

- ✅ **No local storage needed**: Images are hosted externally
- ✅ **CDN benefits**: Faster loading through content delivery networks
- ✅ **Automatic optimization**: Hosting services provide image optimization
- ✅ **Easy updates**: Change images by updating URLs in JSON file
- ✅ **Scalability**: No storage limitations on your server

## Current Image Sources

The portfolio is configured to work with these image hosting services:

- **Unsplash**: `https://images.unsplash.com/`
- **Picsum**: `https://picsum.photos/`
- **Placeholder**: `https://via.placeholder.com/`
- **Source Unsplash**: `https://source.unsplash.com/`

## Adding Project Images

### 1. Image Requirements
- **Format**: Any web-compatible format (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (recommended for consistency)
- **Size**: 800x450px or larger (will be optimized automatically)
- **Quality**: High quality screenshots of your apps

### 2. Hosting Options

#### Option A: Upload to Image Hosting Service
1. Upload your project screenshots to a service like:
   - [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
   - [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
   - [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/)
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) (for stock photos)

2. Get the direct image URL

3. Update the `image` field in `public/json/projects.json`

#### Option B: Use Your Own Server/CDN
1. Upload images to your own server or CDN
2. Use the direct URL in the JSON file

### 3. URL Format Examples

```json
{
  "image": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1234567890?w=800&h=450&fit=crop",
  "image": "https://picsum.photos/800/450",
  "image": "https://via.placeholder.com/800x450/000000/FFFFFF?text=Project+Screenshot",
  "image": "https://your-cdn.com/project-screenshot.jpg"
}
```

### 4. Image Types
- **App Screenshots**: Main screens of your applications
- **UI Mockups**: Design mockups if screenshots aren't available
- **Project Previews**: Key features or interfaces
- **Stock Photos**: Relevant stock images for placeholder projects

### 5. Optimization
- Most hosting services provide automatic optimization
- Use URL parameters for resizing and cropping
- Consider using WebP format for better performance
- Use descriptive alt text in the JSON file

### 6. Fallback
If an image fails to load, a placeholder with an icon will be displayed automatically.

## Tips for Great Project Images

1. **Show the Best Features**: Capture screenshots that highlight key functionality
2. **Consistent Style**: Use similar lighting and composition across all images
3. **High Resolution**: Start with high-res images, hosting services will optimize them
4. **Mobile-First**: Since these are mobile apps, show mobile device mockups when possible
5. **Clean Background**: Use clean, professional backgrounds
6. **Multiple Screens**: Consider showing multiple screens in one image for complex apps
7. **Relevant Stock Photos**: Use stock photos that relate to your project's purpose

## Updating Images

To update project images:

1. **Upload new image** to your preferred hosting service
2. **Get the direct URL** to the image
3. **Update the JSON file**: Replace the `image` field in `public/json/projects.json`
4. **Test**: Refresh your portfolio to see the new image

## Performance Considerations

- **CDN**: Use CDN-hosted images for better performance
- **Optimization**: Choose hosting services that provide automatic optimization
- **Caching**: External images are cached by browsers for faster loading
- **Fallback**: The portfolio handles image loading errors gracefully
